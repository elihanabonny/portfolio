					<p>Sarcasm is Chandler's nickname! If you don't know him he is Chandler Bing, the king of Sarcasm. I love watching clips of his comeback lines. He is a character from Friends which is an American sitcom following the lives of 6 friends living in New York City. We follow them through, their love life, sex life, family moments annd most importantly their friendship.
					I wouldn't be able to summarize such an amazing sitcom. I could easily qualify it as one of my comfort shows! If you haven't watch it, then this is your sign to do so. And if you've watched more than 9999999 times, trust and believe that it won't hurt to watch again, haha.</p>

					<p>BlackIsh is an American sitcom following Dre and his family. Calling them iconic is an understatement. From their outfit choices, their family dynamic to how undoubtely smart they are, you will be glued to your TV like a chewing gum under a shoe. They make you laugh while talking about "sensitive subjects" such as racism, colorism, and so on. I feel like there is not enough Black shows or characters accurately represented but this one is a good one. Just like Friends you can watch it and re-watch it do many without getting tired of it!!</p>

					<p>This Korean drama is actuallly one form my watchlist which means I haven't watched it yet. NO SPOILER PLEASEEE!!!
					<br>
						Anyways, I can't really give you much of an insight but from what I have seen based on the countless amount of tiktoks edit on this drama it has love, comedy, action all in ONE SINGLE drama so I think it will be a fun watch. Now if you are like and watch Kdrama for the plot best believe that you would be hooked from start to finish!
					    Song Kang (from Nevertheless, Sweet Home 1 & 2, Forecast Love & Weather...) is the main lead!!! That man is so captivating (wink wink). You will thank me later, I know it for a fact!

					<p>20th Century girl broke me in the best way possible I cannot even start to express how much I fell in love with the character's love story. I am not going to lie it's a bitter sweet, and some might say very sad ending. It showcases the other side of love. The realistic side of it. Now, I am usually not a fan of realistic drama because I usually want to escape this real world but this movie is worth every second. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. It starts with enemy to lover kind of trope which I loveeeeeee. So watch it, and let me know !!</p>
